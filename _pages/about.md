### James Sullivan

Programming, Machine Learning, NLP


A lifelong learner, I have always enjoyed developing applications with new technologies. I am currently interested in LLMs and applications to finance. In the past, I both developed new products specifically for the Japanese market and enhanced global financial information products to make them competitive in local markets in Asia.
