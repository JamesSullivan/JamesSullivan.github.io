An interesting article from the Atlantic about one of the shortcomings of statistical based translation, which seems to be hitting a wall of diminishing returns in its ability to improve, at least for the way Google is currently implementing it. Google is dropping an automatic-translation tool <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/06/an-economic-burden-google-can-no-longer-bear/240283/">because overuse by spam-bloggers is flooding the Internet with sloppily translated text</a> which in turn is making computerised translation trained on translated text available on the Internet even sloppier.
